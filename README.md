## Our Mission

We launched Citizen Data because we recognized that while the political right and the left enjoy well-oiled data machines, everything else in between was being ignored. Non-partisan, cross-partisan, and bipartisan groups didn’t have the same kind of access to the research, audiences, and analytics they need.

> We’re working to change that. Our mission is to empower these groups with actionable data so they can unite Americans, bridge divides, and advance meaningful change.

Our partners are diverse across many different issue areas. What they have in common is a desire to use data to bring people together around solutions to today’s modern challenges.
